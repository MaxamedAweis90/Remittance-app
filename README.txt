Project Description: Remittance System
--------------------------------------
The Remittance System is a software application designed to facilitate the secure and efficient transfer of money from one user to another. The system allows users to send, receive, and track financial transactions electronically, reducing the need for physical cash and manual processes. It is especially useful for individuals who need to send money across different locations quickly and safely.

The system provides core features such as user registration and authentication, transaction processing, balance management, and transaction history tracking. Administrators can manage users, monitor transactions, and ensure the system operates smoothly and securely. All transaction data is stored in a database to maintain accuracy, transparency, and accountability.

The Remittance System improves financial accessibility by offering a reliable, fast, and user-friendly platform for money transfers. It helps minimize transaction errors, enhances security, and supports better financial record-keeping. This project demonstrates the practical application of web technologies such as PHP and databases in developing a real-world financial system.
